                    Overall, it's safe to say that Abigail Autumn Xiong is inteligent. However, this is solely on a general basis. 
                    On closer observation, it seems that there are times when intelligence levels can vary. 
                </p>

                <div class="inteligenceImage1">
                    <p>While cooking, Abigail is commonly in a state of extreme focus and dedication, with IQ levels 
                        reaching nearly 500. This state has been deemed as "locked tf in" by professionals and is generally when
                        intelligence is at its highest. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="inteligenceImage2">
                    <p>On the other hand, there are sitatuations when intelligence seems to be lacking, but this surely is because
                        we cannot yet fully grasp the complexities of Abigail's workings. Here in this image, she has reached a sort of comatose
                        state we've labeled "no thoughts head empty". More on this later.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="introductionImage">
                    <p>Take a look at those calculating eyes! As shown here in this image, she seems 
                        to be protecting a bublr with tenacious ferocity...ferocious tenacity? I wouldn't get too close if I were you.

            <h1 class="maintext subtext right">What factors affect intelligence?</h1>
            <p class="description sect5">
                One of the most intruiging aspects of this specimen is her flucuations in intelligence. Why, and how, does
                she seamlessly transfer between two drastically different states? After much intense research, we've come to 
                the conclusion that much of the reasoning behind this lies in her immediate, external influences. Factors such as 
                time of day, other humans in her presense, and location, can alter her state of mind.
            </p>
        </div>

       <div class="section6">
        <h1 class="maintext subtext">
            Hover over each image to see even more examples of these drastic flucuations.

        <div class="factor-images">
            <div class="hover-image lockedin1">
                <p>In this image, Abigail's state of mind is nothing short of perfection. Notice the 
                    attention towards her device; the perfect posture. Simply breathtaking. Clearly, IQ 
                    levels are running immensely high in this photo, most likely due to an extremely difficult trial of sorts. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="hover-image notlockedin1">
                <p>Unfortunately, it seems that Abigail was caught off guard attempting to obtain an additional 
                    noodle. Not locked in, indeed. Our photographer was lucky to catch this rare moment on footage.

            <div class="hover-image notlockedin2">
                <p>What you're loooking at is a mystery that us researchers have been trying to resolve for years.
                    We're still not sure what happened to invoke such a monstrous, horrifying state. Beware!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="hover-image notlockedin3">
                <p>Ah, how peaceful! One look in her eyes and you can see that there's not much going on behind there.
                    As she tranquilly (is that a word?) sips a beverage, we can quietly observe her calming nature.

            </div>
            <div class="hover-image lockedin2">
                <p>See how focused she is here in this image. How different from the previous photo! Each piece of food seems to be applied
                    with the upmost precision, like a machine...like clockwork. Facstinating. Very impressive.

                    This state of mind continues to shock and suprise, and whenever you think you know it all, Abigail never
                    fails to deliver to prove you wrong. In short, decisions, problem solving, awareness, spatial awareness, 
                    memory, and reaction speed are all replaced by simply...nothing!

                You might notice that the two videos above seem different, though I assure you that both are in the 
                "no thoughts head empty" state. Could it be that even this state itself can fluctuate? You're right! One of them tends to 
                be a little on the dynamic side, while the other leans a little to the static. Can you determine which is which?
            </p>
            <h1 class="maintext subtext right">The final say.</h1>
            <p class="description sect5">
                So what's the final say? Is Abigail Autumn Xiong worth the 100% rating in intelligence? Without a doubt.
                Unfortunately we could not obtain any visual evidence, but there is certain proof that Abigail Autumn Xiong 
                is currently attending an extremely prestigious university, has the highest volleyball IQ in all of history (more on
                this later), cooks up absoulute heat in the kitchen, and knows her way around the streets. Yes indeed, Abigail is 100% an
                intelligent human.
